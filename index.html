		 <h2>Bachelor of Computer Science (Hons.) Netcentric Computing</h2>
		 <p>On September 23, 2003, I was born in Klang, Selangor. 
		 My other five older sisters and I had a very basic and joyful upbringing. Just like my mother,I am an 
		 introvert who enjoys watching films and listening to music. During my spare time. I used to live 
		 in Petaling Jaya, Selangor. I graduated from Maktab Rendah Sains Mara Pasir Salak (MRSM) in March
		 2021 and am now a full-time science computer student at Uitm Shah Alam. I am also a first-year 
		 student at UiTM Shah Alam, where I am majoring in Netcentric Computing. Like many other students,
		 I am needed to achieve specified criteria in order to be eligible to pursue my chosen profession.
